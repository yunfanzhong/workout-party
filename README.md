## Android setup

If you have an Android device, download the Expo app from the Play Store and scan the QR code [here](https://expo.io/@franktzheng/workout-party) to start the Workout Party app.

Otherwise, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to run an Android emulator on your computer.
The emulator can be started, once running, from the command line that is running the client with the command `a`.

## iOS Setup

_Note: this is not thoroughly tested, as the application was created for Android devices. This is simply intended to be another way to access the application for grading and viewing purposes. It is likely that the aesthetic appearance of the app will be worse and there will be reduced functionality, as some components are Android-specific_
Download the Expo app from the Apple Store. Scan the QR code from the running client on your computer or the QR code [here](https://expo.io/@franktzheng/workout-party) to start the Workout Party app.
