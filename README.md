## Backend server setup

There is a file in the Google Drive called `Server .env`. Copy and paste its
contents into `server/.env`. Then run:

```
cd server
npm i
npm start
```

## Frontend setup

There is a file in the Google Drive called `Client env.json`. Copy and paste its contents into `client/envjson`. Then run:

```
npm i -g expo-cli
npm i
npm start
```

The Expo server should start at `localhost:19002`. If you have an Android device, you should be able to download the Expo app and scan the QR code. Otherwise, try following the instructions [here](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to run an Android emulator on your computer.
